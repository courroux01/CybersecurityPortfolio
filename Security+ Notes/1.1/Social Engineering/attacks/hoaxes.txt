Computer Hoax
- things that seem real but aren't so
- waste of time and resources
- CAN take your money
- a virus hoax can waste as much time as a real one
- pharm -> update your "Adobe player"
- might install a PUP (potentially unwanted program)
- or worse, a malware.

Prevention
- don't believe the internet immediately
- spam filters help
- cross reference
- if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
